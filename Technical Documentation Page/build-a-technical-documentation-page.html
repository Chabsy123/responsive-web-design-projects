            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.</li>
            </ul>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
        </section>

            <header>What you should already know</header>
            <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
                <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
                <li>Some programming experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you are new to programming, we recommend checking out introductory tutorials before proceeding with this documentation.</p>
            <code>console.log('Hello World!');</code>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="JavaScript_and_Java">
            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.</p>
            <p>JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <code>let x = 42;</code>
            <p>In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
            <header>Hello world</header>
            <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { 
    return "Hello " + yourName; 
}</code>
            <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
            <p>This simple function takes a name parameter and returns a greeting string. It demonstrates basic JavaScript syntax including functions, strings, and return statements.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.</p>
            <p>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).</p>
            <code>var x = 5;
let y = 10;
const z = 15;</code>
            <p>You can declare variables in JavaScript in three ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>With the keyword var (function-scoped)</li>
                <li>With the keyword let (block-scoped)</li>
                <li>With the keyword const (block-scoped, constant)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Six primitive types:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean: true and false</li>
                        <li>null: A special keyword denoting a null value</li>
                        <li>undefined: A top-level property whose value is undefined</li>
                        <li>Number: 42 or 3.14159</li>
                        <li>String: "Howdy"</li>
                        <li>Symbol: A unique and immutable primitive value</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
            <code>let name = "John";
let age = 30;
let isStudent = true;</code>
            <p>Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions are the other fundamental elements in the language.</p>
